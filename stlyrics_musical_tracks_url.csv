A contemporary crowd, chic and beautifully dressed, is gathered around various artifacts, all under glass: a small boat, a model of a soldier with a bow and arrow, a mannequin of AMNERIS, ancient female Pharaoh of Egypt. The crowd moves appreciatively around the exhibits. In the center of the room, also behind glass, is a mysterious object - an ancient burial chamber, a tomb. A man and a woman also dressed in the fashions of today approach the tomb from different sides. They are both drawn to it. They circle it, intrigued as if they have seen it before. The man is RADAMES; the woman is AIDA. In a musical moment, they look up. Their eyes meet and all the action in the room freezes as AMNERIS, wearing a royal headdress, emerges from the glass encasement. As she sings, the cast of the modern museumgoers leaves the stage.

AIDA No princess, please don't make me.  AMNERIS I would never make you. But I am asking you, as my friend.  (AMERNIS exits just as RADAMES spots AIDA.)  AIDA Thank you.  RADAMES It was nothing. Actually, it was everything, but it doesn't matter.  AIDA Captain, I just came to tell you that the princess is sorry for what she said the other night. And she wants you to know that...  RADAMES Aida...  (RADAMES tries to take AIDA'S hand but she pulls away.)  AIDA You are betrothed to my mistress!  RADAMES It was arranged by my father, and it will be unarranged by me.  AIDA You could raid another country tomorrow and rebuild your fortune. Radames, you're an Egyptian! Nothing will ever change that fact. I don't even know why you bothered to do this.

Look, everybody knows that I'm the one who can get things. And our people... They've have asked me to bring them... you.  AIDA Why? So they can see a reckless fool dressed as a servant? No that is what I am, Mereb. My father told me not to leave the boundaries of our village, but I could not be so constrained. I took Nehebka and the other women up the river. I had to see the countryside. And that's where the Egyptians captured us. I deserve this. And our people deserve a leader who thinks of them. Not of her own selfish pleasures.

And I can't help but wonder...  MEREB No! Nothing! She said nothing.  (MEREB exits quickly. And the THREE DANCING GIRLS sweep downstage in an ecstatic display. The music builds. The PHARAOH makes a grand entrance on a special sedan chair, carried on shoulders by Palace Servants. He appears very ill. The stage is set with a long low table filled with delicacies.)  RADAMES (To AMNERIS.) You look lovely tonight.  AMNERIS Thank you.  RADAMES Is this the latest fashion?  AMNERIS It is now. So your expedition went well?  RADAMES Oh yes, we got well past Aswan, into territory where no Egyptian has ever set foot.  AMNERIS Really? That sounds very... scenic. Maybe next time I'll go with you.

Thanks to the routes you have discovered, our troops will now be able to attack Nubia with overwhelming force. The Gods willing, this long war shall soon end, with Egypt's complete and final victory. (The court drinks to the toast.) Amneris, shall I continue?  AMNERIS What ever you think is best, father.  PHARAOH Radames. You came to me this morning with a request to set out on another journey. But I have a more important mission for you. Although it means you can never leave Egyptian soil again, I believe this will be a joyous assignment. One I would only trust to a man I have long regarded as a member of my own family  RADAMES It has been my privilege to serve you, Your Majesty.  PHARAOH As you all know, Captain Radames and my daughter have been betrothed for nine years now. Long enough, I'd say. (PHARAOH laughs, but is stopped by a debilitating coughing attack.) I want to see her and our nation happily settled before I leave this world. Therefore, in seven days, Radames, son of Zoser, will wed the Princess Amneris. The Son of Isis has spoken.  (AMNERIS runs to her father's side and shows her appreciation for the announcement. The men gather and congratulate RADAMES. Suddenly, PHARAOH has another attack, coughing uncontrollably.

If I'd known such an awkward young girl would turn into such a stunning young woman, I would have offered for her myself.  RADAMES It's not too late.  ZOSER I thought you loved Amneris?  RADAMES Of course I do. We grew up together.  ZOSER Then what is it? (He waits for an answer.) Radames I've spent years working toward this day.

AIDA That would take a lot of gold  MEREB I have it. For years I've been stealing from the palace. I thought maybe, someday, I could use it to get back to Nubia. But if I can send my King home...  AMONASRO We will all be going home soon, Mereb. Now, how are the docks guarded?  MEREB By the Captain's soldiers.  AMONASRO So the odds are slim. Can you use a sword, boy?  MEREB Me?

MEREB Captain Radames gave you that?  AMONASRO Who is this Captain? An Egyptian?  AIDA Yes, but he's not like the others, father.  AMONASRO He leads Pharaoh's army, and he did not lay waste to our country like the others?  AIDA He regrets his past.  AMONASRO Aida! Do not shame yourself and me with such witless sentiment. Do not tell me this Egyptian grieves for the Nubian men executed, the women ravaged, and the children taken into slavery. Any soft look you have given this Captain, any soft word, betrays the innocents who suffered at his hands and at the hands of every soldier he commands. You will cut this man from your heart.
