Musical Theater Recommendation System. 

Orpheus is a Musical Theater item-to-item recommendation system that recommends 5 musicals based on 1 musical title you enjoy.

It uses neural networks for dimensionality reduction and makes the recommendation based on cosine similarity.
The data used to represent each musical consists of Spotify's music features (tempo, key, danceability, duration, ...) and song lyrics from stlyrics.com.
