Left the theatre and Called the doctor for My appointment to buy...  Tits and ass. Bought myself a fancy pair. Tightened up the derriere. Did the nose with it. All that goes with it.  Tits and ass! Had the bingo-bongos done. Suddenly I'm getting nash'nal tours! Tits and ass won't get you jobs Unless they're yours.  Didn't cost a fortune neither. Didn't hurt my sex life either.  Flat and sassy, I would get the strays and losers. Beggars really can't be choosers. That ain't it, kid. That ain't it, kid.  Fised the chassis. ""How do you do!"" Life turned into and Endless medley of ""Gee it had to be you!"" Why?  Tits and ass! Where the cupboard once was bare Now you knock and someone's there. You have got 'em, hey. Top to bottom, hey.  It's a gas! Just a dash of silicone. Shake your new maracas and you fine! Tits and ass can change your life. They sure changed mine.  Have it all done. Honey, take my word. Grab a cab, c'mon. See the wizard on Park and Seventy-Third For  Tits and ass. Orchestra or balcony. What they want is whatcha see. Keep the best of you. Do the rest of you.  Pits or class. I have never seen it fail. Debutante or chorus girl or wife.  Tits and ass, Yes, tits and ass Have changed... My... Life...! ",musical

Very nearly indispensable Creatures of grace. God knows the foolishness about them, But if one had to live without them, The world would surely be a poorer, If purer, Place.

But the woman was perfection To my deepest dismay. Well, not quite perfection I'm sorry to say. If the woman were perfection She would go away. And that would be wonderful.  Sir, Sir.  If she'd only looked flustered Or admitted the worst, If she only had blustered Or simpered or cursed, If she weren't so awfully perfect, It would have been wonderful.  If, If.  If she'd tried to be clever, If she'd started to flinch, If she'd cried or whatever a woman would do in a pinch, If I'd been certain she never again could be trusted an inch, It would have been wonderful.  But the woman was perfection, Not an action denied. The kind of perfection I cannot abide. If the woman were perfection, She'd have simply lied. Which would have been wonderful.  If she'd only been vicious, If she'd acted abused, Or a bit too delicious, Or been even slightly confused. If she had only been sulky, or bristling, or bulky, or bruised, it would have been wonderful.  If, If.  If she'd only been willful, If she only had fled. Or a little less skillful, Insulted, insisting, In bed, If she had only been fearful, Or married, or tearful, or dead, it would have been wonderful.  But the woman was perfection And the prospects are grim, That lovely perfection That nothing can dim, Yes, the woman was perfection, So I'm here with him.  Sir, sir.  It would have been wonderful.

What's happened to them? Liaisons today. Disgraceful! What's become of them? Some of them Hardly pay their shoddy way. What once was a rare champagne Is now just an amiable hock, What once was a villa, at least, Is ""digs."" What once was a gown with train Is now just a simple little frock, What once was a sumptuous feast Is figs. No--not even figs--raisins! Ah, liaisons! Now, where was I? Where was I? Oh, yes... At the palace of the Duke of Ferrara, Who was prematurely deaf but a dear, At the palace of the Duke of Ferrara I acquired some position Plus a tiny Titian... Liaisons! What's happened to them? Liaisons today. To see them--indiscriminate Women, it Pains me more than I can say, The lack of taste that they display! Where is style? Where is skill? Where is forethought? Where's discretion of the heart? Where's passion in the art? Where's craft? With a smile And a will But with more thought, I acquired a chateau Extravagantly o- Verstaffed. Too many people muddle sex With mere desire, And when emotion intervenes The nets descend. It should on no account perplex, Or worse, inspire; It's but a pleasurable means To a measurable end. Why does no one comprehend? Let us hope this lunacy's just a trend. Now where was I? Where was I? Oh, yes...

Say It's the ravishment, then we see The option That follows, of course: A, The deployment of charm, or B, The adoption Of physical force. Now, B might arouse her, But if I assume I trip on my trouser Leg crossing the room... Her hair getting tangled, Her stays getting snapped, My nerves would be jangled, My energy sapped... Removing her clothing Would take me all day, And her subsequent loathing Would turn me away, Which eliminates B And which leaves us with A. Now, insofar as approaching it, What would be festive But have its effect? Now, there are two ways of broaching it: A, the suggestive, And B, the direct. Say that I settle on B, to wit, A charmingly Lecherous mood, A, I could put on my nightshirt or sit Disarmingly, B, in the nude. That might be effective; My body's all right-- But not in perspective And not in the light. I'm bound to be chilly And feel a buffoon, But nightshirts are silly In mid-afternoon. Which leaves the suggestive, But how to proceed? Although she gets restive, Perhaps I could read. In view of her penchant For something romantic, De Sade is to trenchant And Dickens too frantic, And Stendhal would ruin The plan of attack, As there isn't much blue in ""The Red and the Black."" De Maupassant's candour Would cause her dismay, The Brontes are grander But not very gay, Her taste is much blander, I'm sorry to say, But is Hans Christian Ander- Sen ever risque? Which eliminates A... Now, with my mental facilities Partially muddied And ready to snap, Now, though there are possibilities Still to be studied, I might as well nap.

It's a wink and a wiggle and a giggle in the grass And I'll trip the light fandango, A pinch and a diddle in the middle of what passes by. It's a very short road From the pinch and the punch To the paunch and the pouch And the pension. It's a very short road To the ten thousandth lunch And the belch and the grouch And the sigh. In the meanwhile, There are mouths to be kissed Before mouths to be fed, And a lot in between In the meanwhile. And a girl ought to celebrate what passes by.  Or I shall marry the businessman, Five fat babies and lots of security. Friday nights, if we think we can, We'll go dancing. Meanwhile...  It's a push and a fumble and a tumble in the sheets And I'll foot the highland fancy, A dip in the butter and a flutter with what meets my eye. It's a very short fetch From the push and the whoop To the squint and the stoop And the mumble. It's not much of a stretch To the cribs and the croup And the bosoms that droop And go dry. In the meanwhile, There are mouths to be kissed Before mouths to be fed, And there's many a tryst And there's many a bed To be sampled and seen In the meanwhile. And a girl has to celebrate what passes by.  Or I shall marry the Prince of Wales, Pearls and servants and dressing for festivals. Friday nights, with him all in tails, We'll have dancing. Meanwhile...  It's a rip in the bustle and a rustle in the hay And I'll pitch the quick fantastic, With flings of confetti and my petticoats away up high. It's a very short way From the fling that's for fun To the thigh pressing un- Der the table. It's a very short day Till you're stuck with just one Or it has to be done On the sly. In the meanwhile, There are mouths to be kissed Before mouths to be fed, And there's many a tryst And there's many a bed, There's a lot I'll have missed But I'll not have been dead When I die!

My happiest mistake, the ache of my life: You must meet my wife. She bubbles with pleasure, She glows with surprise, Disrupts my accustomed leisure And ruffles my ties. I don't know even now quite how it began. You must meet my wife, my Anne. One thousand whims to which I give in, Since her smallest tear turns me ashen. I never dreamed that I could live in So completely demented, contented a fashion. So sunlike, so winning, So unlike a wife. I do think that I'm beginning To show signs of life. Don't ask me how at my age one still can grow-- If you met my wife, you'd know.  [DESIREE (speaking):]  Dear Fredrik, I'm just longing to meet her. Sometime.  [FREDRIK]  She sparkles...  [DESIREE]  How pleasant.  [FREDRIK]  She twinkles...  [DESIREE]  How nice.  [FREDRIK]  Her youth is a sort of present--  [DESIREE]  Whatever the price.  [FREDRIK]  The incandescent--what?--the--  [DESIREE (offering a cigarette):]  Light?  [FREDRIK]  --of my life. You must meet my wife.  [DESIREE]  Yes, I must. I really must. Now--  [FREDRIK]  She flutters.  [DESIREE]  How charming.  [FREDRIK]  She twitters.  [DESIREE]  My word!  [FREDRIK]  She floats.  [DESIREE]  Isn't that alarming? What is she, a bird?  [FREDRIK]  She makes me feel I'm--what?--  [DESIREE]  A very old man.  [FREDRIK]  Yes--no!  [DESIREE]  No?  [FREDRIK]  But--  [DESIREE]  I must meet your Gertrude.  [FREDRIK]  My Anne.  [DESIREE]  Sorry--Anne.  [FREDRIK]  She loves my voice, my walk, my mustache, The cigar, in fact, that I'm smoking. She'll watch me puff until it's just ash, Then she'll save the cigar butt.  [DESIREE]  Bizarre, but You're joking.  [FREDRIK]  She dotes on--  [DESIREE]  Your dimple.  [FREDRIK]  My snoring.  [DESIREE]  How dear.  [FREDRIK]  The point is, she's really simple.  [DESIREE]  Yes, that much seems clear.  [FREDRIK]  She gives me funny names--  [DESIREE]  Like?  [FREDRIK]  ""Old Dry-as-Dust.""  [DESIREE]  Wouldn't she just?  [FREDRIK]  You must meet my wife.  [DESIREE]  Yes, I must, yes, I must.  [FREDRIK]  A sea of whims that I submerge in, Yet so loveable in repentance. Unfortunately still a virgin, But you can't force a flower--  [DESIREE]  Don't finish that sentence! She's monstrous!  [FREDRIK]  She's frightened.  [DESIREE]  Unfeeling!  [FREDRIK]  Unversed. She'd strike you as unenlightened--  [DESIREE]  No, I'd strike her first.  [FREDRIK]  Her reticence, her apprehension--  [DESIREE]  Her crust!  [FREDRIK]  No!  [DESIREE]  Yes!  [FREDRIK]  No!  [DESIREE]  Fredrik!  [FREDRIK]  You must meet my wife.  [DESIREE]  Let me get my hat and my knife!  [FREDRIK]  What was that?  [DESIREE]  I must meet your wife.  [FREDRIK AND DESIREE]  Yes, you must. Yes, I must. ",musical
