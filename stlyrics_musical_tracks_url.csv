Left the theatre and Called the doctor for My appointment to buy...  Tits and ass. Bought myself a fancy pair. Tightened up the derriere. Did the nose with it. All that goes with it.  Tits and ass! Had the bingo-bongos done. Suddenly I'm getting nash'nal tours! Tits and ass won't get you jobs Unless they're yours.  Didn't cost a fortune neither. Didn't hurt my sex life either.  Flat and sassy, I would get the strays and losers. Beggars really can't be choosers. That ain't it, kid. That ain't it, kid.  Fised the chassis. ""How do you do!"" Life turned into and Endless medley of ""Gee it had to be you!"" Why?  Tits and ass! Where the cupboard once was bare Now you knock and someone's there. You have got 'em, hey. Top to bottom, hey.  It's a gas! Just a dash of silicone. Shake your new maracas and you fine! Tits and ass can change your life. They sure changed mine.  Have it all done. Honey, take my word. Grab a cab, c'mon. See the wizard on Park and Seventy-Third For  Tits and ass. Orchestra or balcony. What they want is whatcha see. Keep the best of you. Do the rest of you.  Pits or class. I have never seen it fail. Debutante or chorus girl or wife.  Tits and ass, Yes, tits and ass Have changed... My... Life...! ",musical

A Chorus Line,https://www.stlyrics.com/a/achorusline.htm,The Music and the Mirror,https://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/achorusline/themusicandthemirror.htm,"[CASSIE] Give me somebody to dance for, Give me somebody to show. Let me wake up in the morning to find I have somewhere exciting to go.  To have something that I can believe in. To have something to be. Use me... Choose me.  God, I'm a dancer, A dancer dances!  Give me somebody to dance with. Give me a place to fit in. Help me return to the world of the living By showing  me how to begin.  Play the music. Give me the chance to come through. All I ever needed  was the music, and the mirror, And the chance to dance for you.  Give me a job and you instantly get me involved. If you give me a job, Then the rest of the cr*p will get solved. Put me to work, You would think that by now I'm allowed. I'll do you proud.  Throw me a rope to grab on to. Helpome to prove that I'm strong. Give me the chance to look forward to sayin': ""Hey. listen, they're playing my song.""  Play me the music. Give me the chance to come through. All I ever needed was the music, and the mirror, And the chance to dance...  Play me the music, Play me the music, Play me the music. Give me the chance to come through. All I ever needed was the music, and the mirror, And the chance to dance... ",musical
A Chorus Line,https://www.stlyrics.com/a/achorusline.htm,What I Did For Love,https://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/achorusline/whatididforlove.htm,"[Diana] Kiss today goodbye, The sweetness and the sorrow. Wish me luck, the same to you. But I can't regret What I did for love, what I did for love. Look my eyes are dry. The gift was ours to borrow. It's as if we always knew, And I won't forget what I did for love, What I did for love. Gone, Love is never gone. As we travel on, Love's what we'll remember. Kiss today goodbye, And point me t'ward tomorrow. We did what we had to do. Won't forget, can't regret What I did for Love [All] What I did for Love [Diana] What I did for... [All (adding more voices each phrase)] Love Love is never gone As we travel on Love's what we'll remember Kiss today goodbye. [Diana] And point me t'ward tomorrow. [All] Point me t'ward tomorrow We did what we had to do. Won't forget, can't regret What I did for love. What I did for love. [Diana] What I did for love [All] Love ",musical
